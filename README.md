# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

  The goal of this challenge is to see if,  based on the data provided for the AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, what is the relationship between the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) and various variables such as the Length and Weight of the vehicle, Spoiler Angle, Ground Clearance and All Wheel Drive.  



### Deliverable 1: Regression Results

The following table gives the regression results for the MPG as dependent variable, and the other variables mentioned above as explanatory variables.

 All the explanatory vehicle length and clearance, are positively related (their coefficient being positive and also significantly different for zero at 0.0001). Vehicle weight and spoiler angle have turned to be insignificant. We will recommend the AutsRUs team to experiment more on these variables to significantly increase the relationship of these variables with the MPG to boost the sales.

### Deliverable 2: Technical Analysis for Suspension Coil

The summary table shows the following picture as far as Mean, Median, Standard Deviation are concerned.

 The mean and median are now much different and also the standard deviation is low.

 Comparison of three lots shows the following picture:

### Deliverable 3

 The statistical significance analysis was done for the grand mean (1500) with the means for each lot and we again found that the means are within the confidence interval of 95% and hence are not statistically different from the overall mean.

 The box plot for the total sample and the three lots also show that there is not much variation in the mean.

 One Sample Test below confirms that the mean lies in the confidence interval of 95% for the total sample as well as three lots.

t-test for the three lots also confirms the results

  ### Conclusion

  Our advice to AutsRUs will be to experiment more about the efficiency related to the weight and length of the vehicle and do aggressive marketing that all lots are fine and the choice will depend on the consumer preference related to the other factors like the look of the vehicles.
